  orbd -ORBInitialPort 1050 &

  java HelloServer -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost &

  java HelloClient -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost

Windows users: Delete the & from above and use the start command as in:

  start java HelloServer -ORBInitialPort 1050 -ORBInitialHost localhost
